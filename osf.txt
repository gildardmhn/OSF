Create a Node.js app manually (npm init)
Make it run on port 3050
Install express and any other necessary library

Add 4 routes

One route should receive a number and call a function that says if the number is odd or even

One route should render a page sending as parameter the result of a function that generates a random number (the function has to be defined into an external file)

One route should receive a parameter and if it is less than 5, render a page printing the number. Otherwise, just print number without rendering a page.

Send an array of numbers (at least 10 numbers) to the page and render every number using a loop
